Maryam Mirzakhani was an Iranian mathematician and a professor of mathematics at Stanford University. 
Her research topics included Teichmüller theory, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry.
On 13 August 2014, Mirzakhani was honored with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics, becoming the first woman to win the prize, as well as the first Iranian.
The award committee cited her work in "the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces".
Mirzakhani was considered a leading force in the fields of hyperbolic geometry, topology and dynamics.

Throughout her career, she achieved milestones that cemented her reputation as one of the greatest mathematicians of her time, such as the "magic wand theorem", which tied together fields such as dynamical systems, geometry, and topology.
After completing her PhD at Harvard University in 2004, Mirzakhani became a research fellow at the Clay Mathematics Institute and later joined Princeton University as a professor. 
In 2009, she moved to Stanford University, where she continued her pioneering research until her death. 
Her work focused on the intricate and complex dynamics of geometric structures, with particular emphasis on moduli spaces and Riemann surfaces. 
Her approaches and profound insights significantly advanced the field, earning her widespread acclaim and recognition, leading her to win the Fields Medal, the highest honor in mathematics.

Born and raised in Tehran, Mirzakhani's passion for mathematics began at a young age. 
She earned her undergraduate degree from Sharif University of Technology and went on to pursue her PhD at Harvard University under the mentorship of Fields Medalist Curtis T. McMullen. Her academic journey led her to positions at Princeton University and Stanford University, where she became a full professor in 2009. 
Despite her death at the age of 40 due to breast cancer, her legacy endures through numerous accolades in her honor, including the Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize and the 12 May Initiative, both dedicated to promoting women in mathematics.
